## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS custom properties to override some Tailwind properties like font-family
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned the essentials of Tailwind CSS I never knew about before. It was really surprising and beneficial at the same time because I discovered I could still use some custom css properties without creating custom themes
e.g to add width with %, all you have to do is wrap the % in a bracket.
```html
<h1 class="w-[30%]">Instructions</h1>
```

### Continued development

I would continue to explore the amazing world of Tailwind css.


### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for resources to style.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me with the custom CSS
